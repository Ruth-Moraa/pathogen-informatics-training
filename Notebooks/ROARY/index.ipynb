    "## Tutorial sections\n",
    "This tutorial comprises the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Download genomes from the ENA](download_genomes.ipynb)\n",
    "2. [Annotate genomes using Prokka](annotate.ipynb)\n",
    "3. [Run Roary to generate a core gene alignment](run_roary.ipynb)\n",
    "4. [Exploring the results](results.ipynb)\n",

    "## Authors\n",
    "This tutorial was created by [Sara Sjunnebo](https://github.com/ssjunnebo).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the commands from this tutorial\n",
    "You can run the commands in this tutorial either directly from the Jupyter notebook (if using Jupyter), or by typing the commands in your terminal window. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Running commands on Jupyter\n",
    "If you are using Jupyter, command cells (like the one below) can be run by selecting the cell and clicking _Cell -> Run_ from the menu above or using _ctrl Enter_ to run the command. Let's give this a try by printing our working directory using the _pwd_ command and listing the files within it. Run the commands in the two cells below."

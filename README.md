# Pathogen Informatics Training

The courses use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks, which
means that Jupyter must be installed to use them.
Please see the [Jupyter installation instructions](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)
for details.

To use the courses, first take a clone of this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/pathogen-informatics-training.git

Then view the available courses. This will start Jupyter at the main index page:

    jupyter notebook pathogen-informatics-training/Notebooks/index.ipynb
